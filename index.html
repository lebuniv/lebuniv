    <b>Definition Of MetaData:</b><br>

‐ Metadata is Data about data. In other words ,it is a set of data that describes and gives
information about other data.<br>
‐ Metadata is a structured information that describe, explains, locates or otherwise make it easier
to retrieve , use and manage an information resource.(Provide info about 1 or more aspects).<br>

<b>Why do we need metadata?</b><br>
Metadata is created and collected because it enables and improves use of that data. Metadata ensures<br>
that we will be able find data, use data, and preserve and re‐use data in the future.<br>
‐To enable discovery of your digitized material<br>
‐To help you organize your digitized material<br>
‐To support archiving and preservation <br><br>

<b>Purposes of Metadata:</b><br>
‐ Resource Description<br>
‐ Information retrieval and dissemination<br>
‐ Preservation and retention<br>
‐ Ownership and rights management<br>
‐ Managing users and agents<br><br>

<b>Functions of Metadata:</b><br>
‐ Resource discovery<br>
‐ Organizing e‐resources<br>
‐ Facilitating interoperability<br>
‐ Digital Identification<br>
‐ Archiving and preservation<br><br>

<b>Types of Metadata:</b><br>
1) Descriptive metadata :is used for discovery and identification, as information to search and locate an<br>
object, such as title, author, subjects, keywords, publisher.<br>
2)Structural metadata :describes how the components of an object are organized. An example of<br>
structural metadata would be how pages are ordered to form chapters of a book.<br>
3) Administrative metadata :gives information to help manage the source. Administrative metadata<br>
refers to the technical information, including file type.<br><br>

Subsets:<br>
Rights management metadata: deals with intellectual property rights<br>
Preservation metadata: which contains information needed to archive and preserve a resource.<br><br>
    
<b>Metadata standards / schema:</b><br>
1)Dublin Core<br>
2) MODS (Metadata Object Description Schema): can be used on its own or as a complement to other<br>
metadata formats.<br>
3) Darwin Core: This metadata schema is for describing biological specimens<br>
4)Ecological Metadata Language (EML):This metadata schema is for ecological data.<br><br>

What is Dublin Core?<br>
‐The Dublin Core Schema is a small set of vocabulary terms that can be used to describe web resources<br>
(video, images, web pages, etc.), as well as physical resources such as books or CDs, and objects like art<br>
works.<br>
‐Dublin Core is an initiative to create a digital "library card catalogue" for the Web.<br>
‐Dublin Core is made up of 15 metadata (data that describes data) elements that offer expanded<br>
cataloguing information and improved document indexing for search engine programs.<br><br>

<b>Dublin Core Elements: Simple elements:</b><br>
1‐Identifier<br>
2‐Creator<br>
3‐Subject<br>
4‐Description<br>
5‐Publisher<br>
6‐Contributor<br>
7‐Date<br>
8‐Type<br>
9‐Format<br>
10‐Identifier<br>
11‐Source<br>
12‐Language<br>
13‐Relation<br>
14‐Coverage<br>
15‐Rights<br><br>

<b>Qualified elements:</b><br>
1‐Audience<br>
2‐Provenance<br>
3‐Rights Holder<br>
Simple Qualified<br><br>

Simple Dublin Core is Dublin Core metadata that<br>
uses no qualifiers only the main 15 elements of<br>
the Dublin Core .<br><br>

Metadata Element Set are expressed as simple<br>
attribute‐value pairs without any "qualifiers" to<br>
provide more detailed information about a<br>
resource.<br><br>

Qualified Dublin Core employs additional<br>
qualifiers to further refine the<br>
meaning of a resource.<br><br>

<b>Metadata and SEO:</b><br>
1)<b>Meta Tags:</b><br>
‐Meta tags are metadata, but not all metadata are meta tags. Some elements commonly called “tags”<br>
are actually attributes of a tag.<br>
‐The most obvious metadata for SEO are meta tags. A meta tag begin with “meta” followed by name<br>
attributes. When you type a meta description into your CMS, it automatically generates the meta tag in<br>
the correct format.<br>
2)Description: ‐Sometimes used by search engines as the descriptive black text in the search result<br>
listing.<br>
‐meta descriptions can help increase customer clicks in search results, but meta descriptions will not<br>
impact rankings.<br>
‐The description attribute for the meta tag explains the page content in a summary that needs to be at<br>
least 11 words long to display, and will truncate at around 160 characters.<br>
3)Keywords: ‐ Meta keywords ceased to impact rankings in 2009.<br>
‐Bing may still use them, but only as a spam signal. many irrelevant keywords in this attribute may harm<br>
rankings in Bing.<br>
‐ Do not use the keyword attribute unless your internal site search engine requires it.<br>
4)Robots: ‐ meta robots attribute tells search engines whether to index or pass link authority through<br>
the links on a page.<br>
‐The four attributes are “index,” “noindex,” “follow,” “nofollow.”<br>
‐Search engines by default index content and follow links.<br>
5)Title Tags: ‐ Their format is simple, and as with meta tags, your CMS will generate the tag for you from<br>
the title or headline you enter.<br>
‐The best title tags begin with the most relevant keywords, product name, or article name, and end with<br>
the name of the site<br>
‐Stay within 60 characters<br>
6)Image tags: ‐ Search engines primarily use image tags to identify the URLs for the images to be shown<br>
on the page. Other attributes can specify the height and width of the image.<br>
‐Alt is the most important image attribute for SEO, though its relative importance to other SEO factors is<br>
small.<br><br>

<b>Difference between metadata and hashtag:</b><br>
Metadata Hashtag<br>
metadata is data that describes other data,<br>
serving as an informative label<br>
‐hashtag is (internet) a metadata tag, signaled by<br>
a preceding hash sign (#)<br>
‐ used to label content.<br><br>

<b>XML a metadata Language:</b><br>
‐ XML is a meta‐language , a language for defining other languages such as HTML.<br>
‐ I can define a language for expressing customers and all its related objects for a CRM application.<br>
‐For a given object I define a set of metadata or tags , Then use them to find the object easier.<br>
What is XML?<br>
‐XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language.<br>
‐A markup language is used to provide information about a document.<br>
‐Tags are added to the document to provide the extra information.<br>
‐HTML tags tell a browser how to display the document.<br>
‐XML tags give a reader some idea what some of the data means.<br>
What is XML used for?<br>
‐XML documents are used to transfer data from one place to another often over the Internet.<br>
‐XML subsets are designed for particular applications. One is RSS which is used to send breaking news<br>
bulletins from one web site to another.<br>
‐ A number of fields have their own subsets. These include chemistry, mathematics, and books<br>
publishing.<br>
‐Most of these subsets are registered with the W3Consortium and are available for anyone’s use.<br>
