  <h1>Social Network Model Definitions</h1>
  
  <h2>Social Network Model</h2>
  <p>A social network model is a set of actors and the interactions between them. It is represented as a graph, where actors are nodes and interactions are links. Actors can be connected by various types of ties and relations.</p>

  <h2>Definitions</h2>

  <h3>Degree</h3>
  <p>Degree is the sum of connections (or sum of the weights of connections in case of weighted graphs) from or to an actor.</p>

  <h3>Closeness Centrality</h3>
  <p>Closeness centrality is the distance of one actor to all others in the network. It measures how easily an actor can reach all other actors.</p>

  <h3>Betweenness Centrality</h3>
  <p>Betweenness centrality is the number of shortest paths that pass through an actor. It represents how frequently an actor is between other actors' geodesic paths.</p>

  <h3>Eigenvector</h3>
  <p>Eigenvector measures the importance of an actor in the network. It takes into account both the actor's own connections and the connections of their neighboring actors.</p>

  <h3>Out-degree</h3>
  <p>Out-degree is the sum of connections from an actor to others in the network.</p>

  <h3>In-degree</h3>
  <p>In-degree is the sum of connections to an actor from others in the network.</p>

  <h3>HITS</h3>
  <p>HITS (Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search) is a metric used in website analytics. A hit refers to a request made to a website for a particular file to be downloaded from the server. When a user clicks on a web page, regardless of the number of files downloaded, it is called a visit.</p>
