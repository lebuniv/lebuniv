  <h1>Social Network Model Definitions</h1>
  
  <h2>Degree</h2>
  <p>The degree is the sum of connections (or sum of weights of connections in case of weighted graphs) from or to an actor.</p>

  <h2>Closeness Centrality</h2>
  <p>Closeness centrality measures the distance of an actor to all others in the network.</p>

  <h2>Betweenness Centrality</h2>
  <p>Betweenness centrality is the number of shortest paths that pass through an actor. It represents how frequently an actor is between other actors' geodesic paths.</p>

  <h2>Eigenvector</h2>
  <p>Eigenvector measures the importance of an actor in the network.</p>

  <h2>Out-degree</h2>
  <p>The out-degree is the sum of connections from an actor to others.</p>

  <h2>In-degree</h2>
  <p>The in-degree is the sum of connections to an actor from others.</p>

  <h2>HITS</h2>
  <p>HITS (Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search) is a metric used in website analytics. A hit refers to a request made to a website for a particular file to be downloaded from the server. When a user clicks on a web page, regardless of the number of files downloaded, it is called a visit.</p>
