-	A social network model is a set of actors and the interactions between them.<br>
-	It is successfully represented as a graph<br>
o	Actors are nodes and interactions are links<br>
o	Actors might be connected by different kinds of ties and relations<br>
Define:<br>
-	Degree: <br>
o	Sum of connections (sum of the weights of connections in case of weighted graphs) from or to an actor<br>
-	Closeness centrality: <br>
o	Distance of one actor to all others in the network<br>
-	Betweenness centrality: <br>
o	The number of shortest paths that passes through an actor<br>
o	Number that represents how frequently an actor is between other actorsâ€™ geodesic paths<br>
-	Eigen vector: <br>
o	Measures how importance of an actor<br>
-	Out-degree<br>
o	Sum of connections from an actor to others<br>
-	In-degree<br>
o	Sum of connections to an actor<br>
-	HITS:<br>
o	A hit is a metric used in website analytics. A hit is often a request made to a website for a particular file to be downloaded from the server. When a user clicks on a web page, regardless of the number of files downloaded, it is called a visit.<br>
