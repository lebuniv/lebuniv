  <h1>Social Network Model and Representation</h1>
  
  <h2>Social Network Model</h2>
  <p>A social network model is a set of actors and the interactions between them. It is successfully represented as a graph, where actors are nodes and interactions are links. Actors can be connected by different kinds of ties and relations.</p>
  
  <h2>Key Concepts and Measures</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Degree:</strong> Sum of connections (sum of the weights of connections in case of weighted graphs) from or to an actor.</li>
    <li><strong>Out-degree:</strong> Sum of connections from an actor to others.</li>
    <li><strong>In-degree:</strong> Sum of connections to an actor.</li>
    <li><strong>Closeness centrality:</strong> Distance of one actor to all others in the network.</li>
    <li><strong>Betweenness centrality:</strong> The number of shortest paths that pass through an actor, representing how frequently an actor is between other actors' geodesic paths.</li>
    <li><strong>Eigenvector:</strong> Measures the importance of an actor.</li>
    <li><strong>Cliques:</strong> Sub-set of actors more closely tied to each other than to actors who are not part of the subset.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Additional Network Metrics</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Size:</strong> Number of nodes in the network.</li>
    <li><strong>HITS:</strong> A metric used in website analytics to measure hits or requests made to a website for file downloads.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h1>Usage of Social Networks</h1>
  
  <h2>Profile-based</h2>
  <p>Primarily organized around members' profile pages, containing information about an individual member, including their picture and details of interests, likes, and dislikes. Examples include Bebo, Facebook, and MySpace.</p>
  
  <h2>Content-based</h2>
  <p>In these services, user profiles play a secondary role to the posting of content. Examples include YouTube for video sharing, Last.fm for music monitoring and representation, and Flickr for photo sharing.</p>
  
  <h2>Micro-blogging</h2>
  <p>Allows users to publish short messages publicly or within contact groups. Examples include Twitter and Jaiku.</p>
  
  <h2>White-label</h2>
  <p>Offer some group-building functionality, allowing users to form mini-communities within sites. Examples include PeopleAggregator, Ning, and Colexn. However, they seem to be losing popularity.</p>
  
  <h2>Multi-user Virtual Environments</h2>
  <p>Environments that allow users to interact with each other's avatars. Examples include Second Life and World of Warcraft.</p>
  
  <h2>Mobile and Social Search</h2>
  <p>Mobile and social search services also contribute to the usage of social networks.</p>
  
  <h2>Additional Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Social Relation:</strong> Anything that links two actors in a social network.</li>
    <li><strong>Social Network Analysis (SNA):</strong> Powerful analysis based on math/graph theory foundations.</li>
    <li><strong>Walk:</strong> A sequence of actors and relations that begins and ends with actors.</li>
    <li><strong>Geodesic Distance:</strong> The number of relations in the shortest possible walk from one actor to another.</li>
    <li><strong>Maximum Flow:</strong> The amount of different actors in the neighborhood of a source that lead to pathways to a target.</li>
    <li><strong>Social Networking vs. Social Networks:</strong> Social networking refers to the implementation of social networks in the digital world or media.</li>
    <li><strong>Social Roles:</strong> Defined by regularities in the patterns of relations among actors.</li>
    <li><strong>Density:</strong> The number of ties that are present compared to the total number of ties possible in a social network.</li>
  </ul>
