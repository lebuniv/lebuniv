o	Actors are nodes and interactions are links
o	Actors might be connected by different kinds of ties and relations
Define:
-	Degree: 
o	Sum of connections (sum of the weights of connections in case of weighted graphs) from or to an actor
-	Closeness centrality: 
o	Distance of one actor to all others in the network
-	Betweenness centrality: 
o	The number of shortest paths that passes through an actor
o	Number that represents how frequently an actor is between other actorsâ€™ geodesic paths
-	Eigen vector: 
o	Measures how importance of an actor
-	Out-degree
o	Sum of connections from an actor to others
-	In-degree
o	Sum of connections to an actor
-	HITS:
o	A hit is a metric used in website analytics. A hit is often a request made to a website for a particular file to be downloaded from the server. When a user clicks on a web page, regardless of the number of files downloaded, it is called a visit.
